  learnedDesc:
  - This.. Unknown creature, it's too strong... Why did it run away? Why am I still
    alive?
  - According to Jani Kolo, the creature is known to hate fire.
  - The priest at Mako Church told me his brother was infected and went into the sewers.
    It's possible that his brother turned into this horror.. The priest asked me to
    try and use this cure on the creature in hope that it will be his brother and
    will restore him back to being human.
